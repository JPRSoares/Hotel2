Hotel Management System
Welcome to the repository for our Hotel Management System project. This project is a simulation of a real-world hotel management application, designed to handle the basic functionalities of guest check-in and check-out, along with room assignment and management.

Overview
The Hotel Management System is a Java application that provides an interactive experience for hotel staff to manage rooms and guest reservations. It aims to streamline the process of checking guests in and out, as well as keeping track of room occupancy.

Features
Check-In: Allows the hotel staff to check in a guest. The system assigns an available room to the guest and marks it as occupied.
Check-Out: Facilitates the check-out process, freeing up the room for future guests and updating the system accordingly.
Room Management: Keeps an inventory of all the rooms, their occupancy status, and details.
Guest Management: Stores guest information, including name and current room number.
